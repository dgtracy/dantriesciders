## About

This collection features ciders Dan has tried, initially in an extended trip to Vancouver Island but eventually to include ciders from everywhere. Map locations show the place where the cidery is based, as specifically defined as possible given information I can find online. Ratings are purely subjective.

This collection was created using [CollectionBuilder](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/), a set of open source tools for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology.
See [CB Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) for detailed information.
